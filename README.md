This project investigates how integrating economic indicators with behavioral data can enhance forecasting accuracy for stock prices and returns. Using monthly data (2013â€“2024) from ten major U.S. companies, we implement machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, ElasticNet, and Random Forest. Key economic variables such as inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and oil prices are combined with Google Trends data to capture investor sentiment and market attention. Our results indicate that incorporating narrative data, like Google search trends, significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using economic indicators alone. SHAP analysis confirms the importance of Google Trends, particularly during periods of heightened uncertainty. These findings support the Adaptive Market Hypothesis, demonstrating that market dynamics evolve with environmental shifts and investor behavior. This research underscores the potential of merging traditional financial indicators with real-time behavioral insights for more responsive and precise forecasting tools.
