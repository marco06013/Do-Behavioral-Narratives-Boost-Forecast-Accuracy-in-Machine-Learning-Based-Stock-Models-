# Do Behavioral Narratives Boost Forecast Accuracy in Machine Learning-Based Stock Models?
This thesis explores whether combining economic indicators with behavioral data improves stock price and returns forecasting. Using monthly data from 2013 to 2024 for ten major U.S. companies, we apply machine learning models—including XGBoost, ElasticNet, and Random Forest. Key macroeconomic variables such as inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and oil prices are integrated with Google Trends data to reflect investor sentiment and attention. The results show that models including narrative data—like Google search behavior—perform better than those based on economic indicators alone. SHAP analysis confirms Google Trends as a top predictor, especially during high uncertainty periods. The findings support the Adaptive Market Hypothesis, showing that market behavior evolves with changing environments and investor psychology. This research highlights the value of combining traditional finance with real-time narratives to build more accurate, responsive forecasting tools
